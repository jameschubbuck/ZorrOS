## About

ZorrOS is a high level [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) configuration which aims to
create a productive development environment with open source tooling and minimal
distraction. It is written with emphasis on being both portable and scalable -
many modules can be used elsewhere with little or no modification. Home manager
modules and nix modules are automatically imported by the flake and are
differentiated with the `h` or `n` infix which respectively delineate home
manager modules and nix modules.

## Installation

1. Install NixOS either with the
   [official method](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/#ch-installation) or
   in place via [nixos-infect](https://github.com/elitak/nixos-infect) on a
   newly provisioned system.

2. Download the configuration:

```bash
cd /etc/nixos

git init

git remote add origin https://github.com/jameschubbuck/nixos-config.git

git fetch origin

git merge origin/main --allow-unrelated-histories
```

> [!WARNING]
> This may overwrite your current configuration. Use with caution.

3. Generate a machine-specific hardware configuration if one does not already
   exist using
   `nixos-generate-config --show-hardware-config >  /etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix`

4. Edit the default configuration located at `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix` to
   reflect your preferences with `nano`, if no other text editor is present.

5. Build the system with
   `sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake /etc/nixos# --extra-experimental-features "nix-command flakes"`.
   Subsequent runs can be simplified to `sudo nixos-rebuild switch`.

## Overview

| Category | Selection | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Networking | [NetworkManager](https://www.networkmanager.dev) | Simpler to configure and has a wider feature set than wpa_supplicant. |
| Security | [fprint](https://fprint.freedesktop.org/), [GNOME Keyring](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeKeyring), [Hypridle](https://github.com/hyprwm/hypridle) | Enables fingerprint support, system secret storage, and automatic inactivity locking. |
| Kernel | [Linux Kernel](https://kernel.org/) (with [Plymouth](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/Plymouth)) | Uses latest version with low logging, improved sleep via kernelParams, and a boot animation. |
| Browser | [Helium](https://helium.computer/) | Privacy-first ethos implemented via [vikingnope's flake](https://github.com/vikingnope/helium-browser-nix-flake) for automated updates. |
| Desktop Environment | [Hyprland](https://hypr.land/), [Stylix](https://nix-community.github.io/stylix/), [Rofi](https://davatorium.github.io/rofi/), [Dunst](https://dunst-project.org/) | A minimal tiling compositor with automated theming, app launching, and notification management. |
| Hardware | [auto-cpufreq](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq) & fstrim | Handles battery management with simpler configuration than power-profiles-daemon and prolongs SSD lifespan. |
| Terminal | [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) | A performant terminal emulator with extensive configurability for CLI-heavy workflows. |
| Editor | [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) (via [NVF](https://nvf.notashelf.dev/index.html)) | High-extensibility text editing managed through the NVF configuration framework. |
| Shell | [Fish](https://fishshell.com/) & [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) | Fish provides a modern user-facing shell, while Bash is retained for system-level compatibility. |
